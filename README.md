# Word-Counter-Using-Binary-Search-Tree
Created a program that will read in a text file and create a Binary Search Tree of all the words found in that text file 
and create a count for how many times each word appears. There is also a list of stop words such as “a, the, and, or, etc.” 
that will be ignored and not added to the Binary Search Tree. Then I created functions that would allow the user to find a 
certain word in the Binary Search Tree, remove a word, find the parent node of an existing word, or print the tree using 
in order, postorder, and preorder traversal.
